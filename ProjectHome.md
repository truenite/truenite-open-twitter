This is a small scale twitter implementation done for my distributed systems' class.

Done in php with some AJAX.

Should work as a large scale but hasn't been tested that much so if you try it and find any bug, please report it to me so it can be fixed!

If you are going to use it at large scale, please notice that it still needs security protocols to be implemented on it.

There's not any kind of API for this.

What it isn't:

This is NOT a twitter client.
